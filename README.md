## Overview
Fireboy and Watergirl is a two player game in which two chracaters, fireboy and watergirl, are controlled by the players (arrows for fireboy, WSAD for wateriglr). The goal of the game is to get to doors at the end of the map. On the way, they must avoid obstacles that kill them and lead to the loss of the game. Water kills fireboy, lava kills watergirl, and green goo kills them both. There are also various platforms that may block their path. These platforms can be moved by toggling a switch, moving the platform out of the way. 

The game is won when both characters reach their respective doors. After they reach the doors without dying, a win screen is displayed showing the rank received. If the goal is reached within a quick time period and all gems are collected, then the rank is A. To collect gems, you must simply walk through them as you see them on the map.

## Instructions
Fireboy is controlled with the arrow keys. Watergirl is controlled with WSAD. In order to toggle a switch, you must first stand next to it (a grey rectangle on the wall). Then, if you are watergirl, press 'E'. If you are fireboy, press '/'.

If you are stuck, press 'Y' to jump to an easier part of the map.

## Bugs
If you try to jump over a platform, you might phase through it and end up on top of it. Some of the jumps don't work properly, and you may end up phasing through the floor. If it's too difficult, just press 'Y'.
