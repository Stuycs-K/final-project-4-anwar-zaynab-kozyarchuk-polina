## Zaynab Anwar

### 5/22/2024

started on displaying the map in processing

### 5/23/2024

worked on the Block class -- wrote methods that do basic things like determining the type of block and also the constructor. Then I used this to help with the setupMap() method and displaying the obstacles on the initial map.

### 5/24/2024

mainly did some merging stuff with Polina in class (for the Block class, changed the name to obstacle, adding methods to Coordinate class, etc.)

### 5/27/224 

worked on the move() method for the characters. Now, using the D or -> keys, watergirl/fireboy respectively will move to the right. Took a while to make the movement smooth and played around with acceleration too.

### 5/28/2024

worked more on movement. There's a speedup and slowdown method, and this helps the acceleration work smoothly. Now, fireboy and watergirl can move in both directions. Also started working on the jump method. 

### 5/29/2024

did some stuff with placing obstacles randomly--this was how I was originally going to make the tutorial set up.

### 5/30/2024

played around with the map a little bit, started on the printed tutorial

### 5/31/2024

worked on displaying text during gameplay and during the endscreen (minor things like alignment and font)

### 6/3/2024

finally got the restart to work after one of the characters dies. 

### 6/4/2024

since we were having issues with the platforms (the ones that are controlled by the switch), I worked on that. It took a while but I figured out a collide() method so that the characters wouldn't just go through the platforms. 

### 6/5/2024

didn't have much time in class, but I made the window larger and fixed weirdly proportioned objects.
