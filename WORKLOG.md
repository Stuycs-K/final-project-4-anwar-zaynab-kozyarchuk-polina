## Zaynab Anwar

### 5/22/2024

started on displaying the map in processing

### 5/23/2024

worked on the Block class -- wrote methods that do basic things like determining the type of block and also the constructor. Then I used this to help with the setupMap() method and displaying the obstacles on the initial map.

### 5/24/2024

mainly did some merging stuff with Polina in class (for the Block class, changed the name to obstacle, adding methods to Coordinate class, etc.)

### 5/27/224 

worked on the move() method for the characters. Now, using the D or -> keys, watergirl/fireboy respectively will move to the right. Took a while to make the movement smooth and played around with acceleration too.
